      <p>The biggest opportunities and challenges of the data age lies not only in preventing misuse of data, but also
        in facilitating its re-use for the public interest. Data collaboration is hard, developing ethical processes and
        standards for data use is imperative, and human adoption of data-driven practices is slow-moving. Indispensable
        in addressing all these challenges: data stewards.

    <h2><span id="underline">Program Outline</span></h2>
    <p>As we enter the <a href="https://opendatapolicylab.org/third-wave-of-open-data/" target="_blank">third wave of
        open data</a>, in which data use and re-use builds off of the foundation set by
      existing transparency initiatives and open data, it is more important than ever to find new ways to connect the
      demand for data with its supply to meet institutional objectives in a strategic and purposeful way.
      <br><br>
      The Data Stewards Academy Executive Education course will help <a href="http://datastewards.net/"
        target="_blank">data stewards</a>—responsible data leaders in the
      public, private sector, nonprofit or academic sector—develop a data re-use strategy to solve public problems.
      Noting the ways data resources can inform their day-to-day and strategic decision-making, we teach participants
      ways they can use data to improve how they operate and pursue goals in the public’s interests. By working
      differently—using agile methods and data analytics–data stewards can further open data and reduce data access
      inequities in ways that advance their institution’s goals.
      <br><br>
      When learning how to innovate in a large institution, it helps to learn and connect with those who have done it
      before. As part of this course, participants will have the opportunity to participate in virtual field visits at
      leading global organizations to learn from their approach to data re-use. Previous cohorts had the chance to learn
      from teams at Microsoft, Mastercard, DIGI Taiwan, Meta and LinkedIn to name a few.
      <br><br>
      The learning modules are as follows:
    </p>
    <div class="sessions">
      <button class="accordion"><span id="bold">Session 1</span>&nbsp What is Data?<i
          class="material-icons down"></i></button>
      <div class="panel_session">
        <p>
          In this introductory session, we review the evolution of data and data re-use, looking at how data has been
          used to solve public problems. Through the framework of the three waves of open data, participants will learn
          about how views of data use and re-use have changed over time, the impact data re-use has made, and major
          challenges facing the field. </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion"><span id="bold">Session 2</span>&nbsp Data Stewardship<i
          class="material-icons down"></i></button>
      <div class="panel_session">
        <p> Following a discussion of the history of the open data movement, we will discuss current approaches to data
          re-use around the world. We will then shift to the failures of current approaches and the need of current
          approaches and the need to shift from ad hoc engagements to more systematic, sustainable, and responsible
          models. We will introduce the role of a data steward, and how they can promote the responsible, systematic and
          sustainable re-use of data. </p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">
        <span id="bold">Session 3</span>&nbsp Defining Demand<i class="material-icons down"></i></button>
      <div class="panel_session">
        <p>After providing the conceptual framework for discussion, we will discuss the first step in a data re-use
          project: understanding the problem an organization intends to solve and for whom; and how that translates into
          questions data can answer. Participants will learn approaches for quickly researching complex problems,
          assessing public interest in identified problems, and segmenting these potential stakeholders according to
          interests and needs. Using experiences from The GovLab’s 100 Questions Initiative, this session will also
          describe participatory problem definition, topic mapping and how to formulate effective research questions.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion"><span id="bold">Session 4</span>&nbsp Mapping Supply<i
          class="material-icons down"></i></button>
      <div class="panel_session">
        <p>Data re-use requires both relevant data resources and technical capacity. This session will teach
          participants how to assess both. In the first part of the session, we will explain how participants can find
          useful data in their organization and outside it. Participants will learn how to conduct data audits, map the
          location of relevant assets among partner organizations (e.g. companies, nonprofits, and academia), and make
          use of open data platforms. In the latter part of the session, participants will learn the value of internal
          capacity reviews and receive recommendations on how they can build internal support for data projects. These
          explanations will be informed by real-world examples.</p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion"><span id="bold">Session 5</span>&nbsp The Value Proposition <i
          class="material-icons down"></i></button>

      <div class="panel_session">
        <p>Before we bring demand and supply together, it can be helpful to understand the value proposition behind data
          sharing. This session includes information on the societal and business cases underlying data re-use, as well
          as the latent risks that exist in the data lifecycle. We will explore tools that can help you measure the
          costs and benefits of your data re-use project, as well as methods to avoid misusing data. We will also
          briefly look at the environmental footprint and other externalities of data initiatives. </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion"><span id="bold">Session 6</span>&nbsp Operational Models of Collaboration <i
          class="material-icons down"></i></button>
      <div class="panel_session">
        <p>Building off of our previous sessions focused on demand and supply, we look at how to bring the two sides
          together. This session will introduce you to different models of data collaboration and how to identify a
          fit-for-purpose collaborative model for your project. We will also look at the technical aspects of governing
          a data collaborative, including existing governance frameworks and the role of data-sharing agreements, as
          well as the technological infrastructure needed to build a sustainable collaborative.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion"><span id="bold">Session 7</span>&nbsp Measuring Impact<i
          class="material-icons down"></i></button>
      <div class="panel_session">

        <p>Once you’ve established your data collaborative, it is important to understand its impact on the challenge
          you initially sought to address and the ecosystem as a whole. This session looks at the use of logic models to
          measure impact. For a data steward, impact measurement can play a big role in ensuring the sustainability of
          your project in the form of investment and organizational buy-in.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion"><span id="bold">Session 8</span>&nbsp Institutionalizing Data Reuse<i
          class="material-icons down"></i></button>
      <div class="panel_session">

        <p>Data re-use projects can address public problems but their potential is best realized when they can be
          maintained in the long term. As such, organizations need to make changes in how they operate, ensuring they
          are positioned to take advantage of future cross-sector data collaborations. In this session, we will
          demonstrate that systematic, sustainable, and responsible data re-use can be best realized through the
          creation of a data steward position within an organization. The session will discuss how this role can
          coordinate efforts investigating where relevant data is, who has it, who needs it, and how it can best be used
          to tackle the problem. It will also discuss the role of the data steward in assessing human infrastructure,
          telling organizations what their gaps are and who they need to collaborate with and the priority they should
          assign to these relationships.</p>

        discussing with peer about problems and challenges that all Data Stewards face in our daily work.”<br><br>

      <p>“As the saying goes, ‘In a world befogged by superficiality, moments of clarity are few and far between.’ The
        executive data stewardship course by GovLab offers that rare and special light bulb moment. The organization of
        the course was excellent and choice of facilitators exceptional. In just a few weeks, we gained knowledge and
        practical skills and a deeper meaning and understanding of what data stewardship is and learnt how as leaders we
        can develop data re-use strategies to solve public problems.”<br><br>
