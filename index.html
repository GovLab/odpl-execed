<h4>Developing a Data Re-Use Strategy for Solving Public Problems</h4>

    <div class="intro-text-box">
      <p>Communities across the world face unprecedented challenges. Strained by climate change, crumbling
        infrastructure, growing economic inequality, and the continued costs of the COVID-19 pandemic, institutions need
        new ways of solving public problems and improving how they operate.
      </p>
      <p></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="text">
    <p>In recent years, data has been increasingly deployed to inform policies targeted at these issues. Yet, many of
      these data projects, data collaboratives, and open data initiatives remain scattered and atomized. As we enter
      into a new age of data use and reuse, a third wave of open data, it is more important than ever to be strategic
      and purposeful, to find new ways to connect the demand for data with its supply to meet institutional objectives.
    </p>
    <p>This program tries to help leaders in the public and private sector develop a data re-use strategy to solve
      public problems. Noting the ways in which data resources can inform their day-to-day and strategic
      decision-making, we teach participants ways in which they can use data to improve how they operate and pursue
      goals in the public’s interests. By working differently—using agile methods and data analytics—public sector and
      private sector leaders can further open data and reduce data access inequities in ways that advance their
      institution’s goals.</p>

          class="material-icons down"></i></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          In this introductory session, we review the history of data reuse and the ways in which it has solved public
          problems. Through the framework of the three waves of open data, participants will learn about how views of
          data use and reuse have changed over time, the impact data reuse has made, and major challenges facing the
          field. This information will be conveyed through paradigmatic examples that illustrate different models of
          data use.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion"><span id="bold">Session 2</span>&nbsp The Current State of Play<i
          class="material-icons down"></i></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p> Following a discussion of the history of the movement, we will discuss current approaches to data reuse
          around the world. This session will further develop the discussion of data models introduced
          previously—focusing on freedom of information, open government data, and data collaboration. It will then
          shift to the current failures of current approaches and the need to shift from ad hoc engagements to more
          systematic, sustainable, and responsible models. Participants will receive a detailed explanation of the
          changes needed to realize a third wave of open data and the ways in which the third wave can produce public
          value. </p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">
        <span id="bold">Session 3</span>&nbsp Defining Demand<i class="material-icons down"></i></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>After providing the conceptual framework for discussion, we will discuss the first step in a data reuse
          project: understanding the problem an organization intends to solve and for whom; and how that translates into
          questions data can answer Participants will learn approaches for quickly researching complex problems,
          assessing public interest in identified problems, and segmenting these potential stakeholders according to
          interests and needs. Using experiences from The GovLab’s 100 Questions Initiative, this session will also
          describe participatory problem definition and agenda setting, processes which require the capacity to listen
          to all people affected or involved in that particular area inside and outside the organization. </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion"><span id="bold">Session 4</span>&nbsp Mapping Supply<i
          class="material-icons down"></i></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Data reuse requires both relevant data resources and technical capacity. This session will teach participants
          how to assess both. In the first part of the session, we will explain how participants can find useful data in
          their organization and data outside it. Participants will learn how to conduct data audits, map the location
          of relevant assets among partner organizations (e.g. companies, nonprofits, and academia), and make use of
          open data platforms. In the latter portion of the session, participants will learn the value of internal
          capacity reviews and receive recommendations on how they can build internal support for data projects. These
          explanations will be informed by real-world examples.</p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion"><span id="bold">Session 5</span>&nbsp Operational Models of Collaboration<i
          class="material-icons down"></i></button>

      <div class="panel">
        <p>Data reuse efforts can take several forms depending on the operational and organizational needs of supply and
          demand stakeholders. In this session, we will provide an overview of the forms these relationships can take,
          focusing on two axes: Engagement and Accessibility. We will also provide guidance on the organizational
          decisions that data reuse stakeholders must make about how their work is to be governed and maintained.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion"><span id="bold">Session 6</span>&nbsp Identifying Risks<i
          class="material-icons down"></i></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The use and reuse of data is not without risks to data practitioners, the intended beneficiaries of their
          projects, and others. In this session, we will review the various dangers that data practitioners need to be
          aware of, including those related to privacy, data security, poor decision-making, and open washing.
          Participants will additionally learn about the different risks data reuse poses to individuals, a relatively
          well-discussed issue, and groups, a relatively under-discussed problem.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion"><span id="bold">Session 7</span>&nbsp Mitigating Risks and Other Legal Considerations<i
          class="material-icons down"></i></button>
      <div class="panel">

        <p>Data reuse projects, such as data collaboratives, need policies and procedures that allow all participants to
          understand their roles and interact with the data in an ethical, legal, and responsible manner. In this
          session, we will seek to demystify the legal and governance elements of data collaboration to address the
          risks identified in the previous section. Using the Contractual Wheel of Data Collaboration as a model, we
          will invite participants to explore the why, what, who, how, when, and where of their legal agreements and
          demonstrate the different forms these elements can take.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion"><span id="bold">Session 8</span>&nbsp Institutionalizing Data Reuse<i
          class="material-icons down"></i></button>
      <div class="panel">

        <p>Data reuse projects can address public problems but their potential is best realized when they can be
          maintained in the long term. As such, organizations need to make changes in how they operate, ensuring they
          are positioned to take advantage of future cross-sector data collaborations. In this session, we will
          demonstrate that systematic, sustainable, and responsible data reuse can be best realized through the creation
          of a data steward position within an organization. The session will discuss how this role can coordinate
          efforts investigating where relevant data is, who has it, who needs it, and how it can best be used to tackle
          the problem. It will also discuss the role of the data steward in assessing human infrastructure, telling
          organizations what their gaps are and who they need to collaborate with and the priority they should assign to
          these relationships.</p>

    <div style="padding-top:0" class="text">
      <p style="padding:0">An initiative of The GovLab with support from Microsoft, the Open Data Policy Lab seeks to
        accelerate the responsible re-use and opening of data for the benefit of society and the equitable spread of
        economic opportunity. As part of this mission, the Open Data Policy Lab supports decision-makers at local,
        state, and national levels, crafting a series of tools to help navigate and respond to the challenges posed by
        the third wave of open data. The GovLab, based at the Tandon School of Engineering at New York University, aims
        to promote openness, collaboration, and legitimacy in governance through the use of data.</p>
