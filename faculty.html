        <h3>Stefaan Verhulst</h3>
        <h5>The Governance Lab</h5>
        <p>Stefaan G. Verhulst is Co-Founder and Chief Research and Development Officer of the Governance Laboratory
          @NYU (GovLab) where he is building an action-research foundation on how to transform governance using advances
          in science, data, and technology.
          He is the Editor-in-Chief of Data and Policy (an Open Access Journal by Cambridge University Press) and
          Curator-in-Chief of the Living Library and The Digest.
          Verhulst’s latest scholarship centers on how technology can improve people’s lives and the creation of more
          data-driven and collaborative forms of governance. Specifically, he is interested in the perils and promise of
          collaborative technologies and how to unlock the unprecedented volume of data to advance the public good in a
          responsible way.</p>

        <div class="panel">
          <p>Before joining New York University full time, Verhulst spent more than a decade as Chief of Research for
            the
            Markle Foundation, where he continues to serve as Senior Advisor. At Markle, an operational foundation based
            in New York, he was responsible for overseeing strategic research on all the priority areas of the
            Foundation
            including, for instance: transforming health care using information and technology, re-engineering
            government
            to respond to new national security threats, improving people’s lives in developing countries by connecting
            them to information networks, developing multi-stakeholder networks to tackle global governance challenges,
            changing education through information technology et al. Many of Markle’s reports have been translated into
            legislation and executive orders, and have informed the creation of new organizations and
            businesses.<br><br>
            Previously at Oxford University he co-founded and was the Head of the Programme in Comparative Media Law and
            Policy at the Centre for Socio Legal Studies, and also served as Senior Research Fellow of Wolfson College.
            He
            is still an emeritus fellow at Oxford. He also taught several years at the London School of Economics.
            Verhulst was the UNESCO Chairholder in Communications Law and Policy for the UK, and Founder and Co-Director
            of the International Media and Info-Comms Policy and Law Studies at the University of Glasgow School of Law.
            He has served as a consultant to numerous international and national organizations, including the Council of
            Europe, the European Commission, UNESCO, World Bank, UNDP, USAID, the UK Department for International
            Development among others. He has been a grant recipient of the Bertelsmann Foundation, the Ford Foundation,
            the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Markle Foundation.<br><br>
            Verhulst has authored and co-authored several books, including: In Search of the Self: Conceptual Approaches
            to Internet Self Regulation (Routledge, 2001); Convergence in European Communications Regulation
            (Blackstone,
            1999); EC Media Law and Policy (AWL, 1998); Legal Responses to the Changing Media (OUP, 1998); and
            Broadcasting Reform in India (OUP, 1998) and The Routledge Handbook of Media Law (2013).<br>
            Latest reports and papers include, for instance, Innovations in Global Governance: Toward a Distributed
            Internet Governance Ecosystem (2014) and The Open Data Era in Health and Social Care (2014), and are also
            available here. Verhulst blogs also regularly on a variety of topics. For instance: Data Collaboratives:
            Exchanging Data to Improve People’s Lives (2015), and Reimagining Cities (2014).<br>
            Verhulst is also founder and editor of numerous journals including the International Journal of
            Communications
            Law and Policy, and the Communications Law in Transition Newsletter.

          of technology on public institutions. Among the grant-funded projects he has directed are a global assessment
          of the impact of open government data; comparative benchmarking of government innovation efforts against those
          of other countries; a methodology for leveraging corporate data to benefit the public good; and crafting the
          experimental design for testing the adoption of technology innovations in federal agencies.</p>
        <div class="panel">
          <p><br>Andrew has authored or co-authored a number of extended works on new approaches for improving

            for civil servants and the Open Governance Research Exchange (OGRX), a collaborative project of the GovLab,
            World Bank, and mySociety to develop a platform for accessing and sharing original research on governance
            innovation.<br><br>
            In his role as Knowledge Director, Andrew seeks to make GovLab’s research more accessible and actionable,
            and
            provides research and writing support to all members of GovLab’s team and to its extended network of
            participants in GovLab’s training programs.
            Andrew earned his Master’s degree in the Media, Culture and Communication department of NYU’s Steinhardt
            School of Culture, Education and Human Development, with a focus on Technology and Society. His Master’s
            thesis explored the use of data-tracking technologies on congressional campaign websites to inform
            microtargeting efforts.<br><br>
            Before arriving at the GovLab, Andrew worked with Chief of Research Stefaan Verhulst at the Markle
            Foundation,
            where his research centered on the use of technology to bolster economic security.
            Prior to his graduate work at NYU, Andrew attended Pennsylvania State University and Goldsmiths College,
            University of London, where he studied English and Communications. His writings can be found in Harvard
